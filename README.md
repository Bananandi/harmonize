# harmonize

The Harmonize Web App consists of a svelte frontend and an express server that communicates with MongoDB.
It has these fundamental functionalities:
- load all songs from db
- remove specific song
- add song
- update song

There is also an "frontend test mode" that works with the svelte dev server too and loads just a few local stored test songs. This is extremely helpful for editing the frontend because the dev server can hot reload.
